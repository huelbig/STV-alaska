## **Surface Type Variability across Alaska, U.S.**
#### *Maddie Huelbig*

*Project Summary:* I am interested in looking at surface-type data in the Arctic, specifically in Alaska, to understand variability across landscapes. Using the BAWLD data set, and potentially PLD data, I can determine how variable the surface type is and how this may affect lake/river connectivity and/or change over time. 

*Problem Statement:* How does surface-type variability affect lake and/or river connectivity over time? Maybe: How different are surface types within a specific basin/watershed? How variable is surface type across all basins in Alaska? 

*Datasets intended for use:*

* Boreal Arctic Wetland and Lakes Data Set (BAWLD)
* Prior Lake Database (PLD from SWOT)
* Planet data (maybe)

*Required Python Packages:*

1. Geopandas 
2. Numpy
3. Rasterio
4. Matplotlib
5. Pandas

*Planned methods/approach:* I want to intersect the BAWLD data set with the PLD database. I also need to categorize the surface-types come with the BAWLD data set. For the purpose of this class, I will probably ask Spyder to randomly generate a few basins that I can analyze. I still need to hash some ideas out with my advisor so this can also benefit my masters' work.

*Expected outcomes:* Hopefully there is a wide array of variability! This would be really promising for my research. I would like to produce some graphs/plots, maybe a time series for practice.
